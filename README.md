# blogmail

## Motivation

My own simple blogging engine, which powers blackmail.dev

## Features

- Create a post
- Create an rss feed based on a posts.json
- Create an opml file (so I can import it into my rss reader, which can't for some reason eat normal rss xml)

## License

This project is licensed under the GPL-3 license.
